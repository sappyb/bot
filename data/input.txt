Teacher_FUNGI : What is a fungus?
Student_FUNGI : A fungus is from a group of organisms—we call them fungi—that share a lot of characteristics with plants but also some characteristics with animals.  
By that I mean, they are all eukaryotic (meaning they have a nucleus in their cells)—like plants and animals. Fungi have cell walls (these rigid covering for their cells)—like plants but NOT animals.  But they are different from plants in that they don’t photosynthesize (meaning they can’t capture sunlight as an energy source), instead like animals they are heterotrophs (meaning they eat other plants or animals for energy and nutrients).  So, fungi are similar to but different from both plants and animals.
Teacher_FUNGI : What are some examples of fungus from everyday life?
Student_FUNGI : Some unicellular (meaning made of 1 cell) fungi include yeast, which we use to make bread. Some multicellular (meaning made of more than 1 cell) fungi include molds (which are used to make cheese), mushrooms (that we use on pizzas) and toadstools (that you can often see growing in your yard).
Teacher_FUNGI : What do fungus eat to get the energy they need to grow and reproduce? 
Student_FUNGI : Fungi are called heterotrophs (hetero means “other”, and trophs refers to “eaters”…so they are “other eaters”). This means they have to find their energy from consuming other organic materials or other organisms.  Unlike plants, they cannot capture sunlight to make large organic molecules, but have to find their energy that has already been captured by others.  So in this way they are much more similar to animals and plants.   
Teacher_FUNGI : How do they eat?
Student_FUNGI : Because fungi get their energy from breaking down other organisms. To do this, they secrete digestive juices, and these are used to breakdown the organic matter around them. Imagine a mushroom growing on a fallen log, or mold growing on an old piece of bread in your refrigerator.  The fungi grow tubular structures known as hyphae that branch into the dead matter and produce digestive enzymes. These digestive enzymes break down the complex matter that the fungus is growing on (the log or the bread), then those simpler materials are absorbed by the fungus.
Teacher_FUNGI : What makes fungi important in a food chain?
Student_FUNGI : As saprophyte organisms feed, they break down decaying debris left by dead plants and animals. After the debris is broken down, what remains are rich minerals that become part of the soil. These minerals are essential for healthy plants.Fungi are saprophytes, which are the living organisms that live and feed on dead and decaying organisms. They are considered extremely important in soil biology. They break down the complex organic matter into simpler substances that are taken up by the plants for various metabolic activities. By breaking down complex materials (such as dead animals and plans) and breading them down into simpler molecules, fungi make these molecules available for plants for their own developmental means.  By playing a role in the recycling of materials, breaking down dead matter into simpler molecules that can be used by other organisms, fungi are super important in the ecosystem.

Teacher_FUNGI : How are fungi important to humans—aside from their importance in ecosystems?
Student_FUNGI : Fungi are very important to as food and in producing different sorts of foods.  We use yeast to make bread, alcohol (beers and other kinds of alcohols), and other fermented foods (kimchee, and kombucha).We also use molds to produce different flavors of cheese, to make soy sauce and sausages such as salami). And many people eat mushrooms as a food staple, as well as truffles for flavoring.And importantly, fungi help produce antibiotics such as Penicillin.But Fungi are not always good, fungi can be harmful for humans too.  They are responsible for spoiling food when molds can find a home in food and begin to grow there.  You can see these fungi as a “fuzzy mat” or white spots on the top of leftovers you find in your refrigerator. Fungi can also destroy crops, cause diseases in humans, for example, yeast infections, thrush, diaper rash and ringworm.  Specific kinds of fungi, such as molds, can ruin clothing, furniture, and books with mildew and rot.
Teacher_FUNGI : How do fungi reproduce?
Student_FUNGI : Fungi tend to reproduce asexually most of the time (meaning that they don’t need to have another fungus around to reproduce). That is because asexual reproduction is faster and quickly results in more fungi.   Asexual reproduction in fungi can be done through budding (in which a bud or small “nub” forms on the surface of a fungus which eventually breaks off ), fragmentation (when a piece of the fungus breaks off to form a new organisms) or spores ( light weight, tiny packets that include all the genetic information from the parents).  Spores can be produced by the parent fungus in huge numbers that move away the parent by either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal.

Student_FUNGI : Some unicellular (meaning made of 1 cell) fungi include yeast, which we use to make bread. Some multicellular (meaning made of more than 1 cell) fungi include molds (which are used to make cheese), mushrooms (that we use on pizzas) and toadstools (that you can often see growing in your yard).
Teacher_FUNGI : What do fungus eat to get the energy they need to grow and reproduce? 
Student_FUNGI : Fungi are called heterotrophs (hetero means “other”, and trophs refers to “eaters”…so they are “other eaters”). This means they have to find their energy from consuming other organic materials or other organisms.  Unlike plants, they cannot capture sunlight to make large organic molecules, but have to find their energy that has already been captured by others.  So in this way they are much more similar to animals and plants.
Teacher_FUNGI : What is a fungus?
Student_FUNGI : A fungus is from a group of organisms—we call them fungi—that share a lot of characteristics with plants but also some characteristics with animals.  
By that I mean, they are all eukaryotic (meaning they have a nucleus in their cells)—like plants and animals. Fungi have cell walls (these rigid covering for their cells)—like plants but NOT animals.  But they are different from plants in that they don’t photosynthesize (meaning they can’t capture sunlight as an energy source), instead like animals they are heterotrophs (meaning they eat other plants or animals for energy and nutrients).  So, fungi are similar to but different from both plants and animals.

So in this way they are much more similar to animals and plants.   
Teacher_FUNGI : How do they eat?
Student_FUNGI : Because fungi get their energy from breaking down other organisms. To do this, they secrete digestive juices, and these are used to breakdown the organic matter around them. Imagine a mushroom growing on a fallen log, or mold growing on an old piece of bread in your refrigerator.  The fungi grow tubular structures known as hyphae that branch into the dead matter and produce digestive enzymes. These digestive enzymes break down the complex matter that the fungus is growing on (the log or the bread), then those simpler materials are absorbed by the fungus.
Teacher_FUNGI : What makes fungi important in a food chain?
Student_FUNGI : As saprophyte organisms feed, they break down decaying debris left by dead plants and animals. After the debris is broken down, what remains are rich minerals that become part of the soil. These minerals are essential for healthy plants.Fungi are saprophytes, which are the living organisms that live and feed on dead and decaying organisms. They are considered extremely important in soil biology. They break down the complex organic matter into simpler substances that are taken up by the plants for various metabolic activities. By breaking down complex materials (such as dead animals and plans) and breading them down into simpler molecules, fungi make these molecules available for plants for their own developmental means.  By playing a role in the recycling of materials, breaking down dead matter into simpler molecules that can be used by other organisms, fungi are super important in the ecosystem.

Teacher_FUNGI : How are fungi important to humans—aside from their importance in ecosystems?
Student_FUNGI : Fungi are very important to as food and in producing different sorts of foods.  We use yeast to make bread, alcohol (beers and other kinds of alcohols), and other fermented foods (kimchee, and kombucha).We also use molds to produce different flavors of cheese, to make soy sauce and sausages such as salami). And many people eat mushrooms as a food staple, as well as truffles for flavoring.And importantly, fungi help produce antibiotics such as Penicillin.But Fungi are not always good, fungi can be harmful for humans too.  They are responsible for spoiling food when molds can find a home in food and begin to grow there.  You can see these fungi as a “fuzzy mat” or white spots on the top of leftovers you find in your refrigerator. Fungi can also destroy crops, cause diseases in humans, for example, yeast infections, thrush, diaper rash and ringworm.  Specific kinds of fungi, such as molds, can ruin clothing, furniture, and books with mildew and rot.
Teacher_FUNGI : How do fungi reproduce?
Student_FUNGI : Fungi tend to reproduce asexually most of the time (meaning that they don’t need to have another fungus around to reproduce). That is because asexual reproduction is faster and quickly results in more fungi.   Asexual reproduction in fungi can be done through budding (in which a bud or small “nub” forms on the surface of a fungus which eventually breaks off ), fragmentation (when a piece of the fungus breaks off to form a new organisms) or spores ( light weight, tiny packets that include all the genetic information from the parents).  Spores can be produced by the parent fungus in huge numbers that move away the parent by either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal.

Spores can be produced by the parent fungus in huge numbers that move away the parent by either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal.
Teacher_FUNGI : What is a fungus?
Student_FUNGI : A fungus is from a group of organisms—we call them fungi—that share a lot of characteristics with plants but also some characteristics with animals.  
By that I mean, they are all eukaryotic (meaning they have a nucleus in their cells)—like plants and animals. Fungi have cell walls (these rigid covering for their cells)—like plants but NOT animals.  But they are different from plants in that they don’t photosynthesize (meaning they can’t capture sunlight as an energy source), instead like animals they are heterotrophs (meaning they eat other plants or animals for energy and nutrients).  So, fungi are similar to but different from both plants and animals.
Teacher_FUNGI : What are some examples of fungus from everyday life?
Student_FUNGI : Some unicellular (meaning made of 1 cell) fungi include yeast, which we use to make bread. Some multicellular (meaning made of more than 1 cell) fungi include molds (which are used to make cheese), mushrooms (that we use on pizzas) and toadstools (that you can often see growing in your yard).
Teacher_FUNGI : What do fungus eat to get the energy they need to grow and reproduce? 
Student_FUNGI : Fungi are called heterotrophs (hetero means “other”, and trophs refers to “eaters”…so they are “other eaters”). This means they have to find their energy from consuming other organic materials or other organisms.  Unlike plants, they cannot capture sunlight to make large organic molecules, but have to find their energy that has already been captured by others.  So in this way they are much more similar to animals and plants.

Teacher_FUNGI : How do they eat?
Student_FUNGI : Because fungi get their energy from breaking down other organisms. To do this, they secrete digestive juices, and these are used to breakdown the organic matter around them. Imagine a mushroom growing on a fallen log, or mold growing on an old piece of bread in your refrigerator.  The fungi grow tubular structures known as hyphae that branch into the dead matter and produce digestive enzymes. These digestive enzymes break down the complex matter that the fungus is growing on (the log or the bread), then those simpler materials are absorbed by the fungus.
Teacher_FUNGI : What makes fungi important in a food chain?
Student_FUNGI : As saprophyte organisms feed, they break down decaying debris left by dead plants and animals. After the debris is broken down, what remains are rich minerals that become part of the soil. These minerals are essential for healthy plants.Fungi are saprophytes, which are the living organisms that live and feed on dead and decaying organisms. They are considered extremely important in soil biology. They break down the complex organic matter into simpler substances that are taken up by the plants for various metabolic activities. By breaking down complex materials (such as dead animals and plans) and breading them down into simpler molecules, fungi make these molecules available for plants for their own developmental means.  By playing a role in the recycling of materials, breaking down dead matter into simpler molecules that can be used by other organisms, fungi are super important in the ecosystem.

Teacher_FUNGI : How are fungi important to humans—aside from their importance in ecosystems?
Student_FUNGI : Fungi are very important to as food and in producing different sorts of foods.  We use yeast to make bread, alcohol (beers and other kinds of alcohols), and other fermented foods (kimchee, and kombucha).We also use molds to produce different flavors of cheese, to make soy sauce and sausages such as salami). And many people eat mushrooms as a food staple, as well as truffles for flavoring.And importantly, fungi help produce antibiotics such as Penicillin.But Fungi are not always good, fungi can be harmful for humans too.  They are responsible for spoiling food when molds can find a home in food and begin to grow there.  You can see these fungi as a “fuzzy mat” or white spots on the top of leftovers you find in your refrigerator. Fungi can also destroy crops, cause diseases in humans, for example, yeast infections, thrush, diaper rash and ringworm.  Specific kinds of fungi, such as molds, can ruin clothing, furniture, and books with mildew and rot.
Teacher_FUNGI : How do fungi reproduce?
Student_FUNGI : Fungi tend to reproduce asexually most of the time (meaning that they don’t need to have another fungus around to reproduce). That is because asexual reproduction is faster and quickly results in more fungi.   Asexual reproduction in fungi can be done through budding (in which a bud or small “nub” forms on the surface of a fungus which eventually breaks off ), fragmentation (when a piece of the fungus breaks off to form a new organisms) or spores ( light weight, tiny packets that include all the genetic information from the parents).
